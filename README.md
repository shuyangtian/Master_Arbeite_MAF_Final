Minimizing the Power Consumption of Medical Applications

This project implements a Gurobi-based optimization model for **minimizing the power consumption of medical applications** by scheduling **Modular Application Function (MAF)** efficiently across multiple processing units (PUs). The model focuses on reducing **energy usage** while satisfying constructions on **latency**, **PU capacity**, and **MAF Task Chain dependencies**

This work is part of the master's thesis titled:
